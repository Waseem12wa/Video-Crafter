  "transcript_text": " Every time I discharge an elderly patient who lives the loan from Bristol Royal Infermary, I tell them, you'll be fine. Just follow the instructions. But here's the truth. I'm lying. They won't be fine. Not if they choke. Because the instructions we give them, the self-heimlich, the call 999, they don't work when you're alone. I'm Emma Thornton, and I'm tired of lying to people who trust me. The NHS discharge protocol is beautiful on paper. In reality, it's sending people home to die, preventable deaths, and I can't stay silent anymore. Here's the anatomy of the lie. We tell patients, if you have trouble breathing, call 999 immediately. But when you're choking, you can't speak. You can't call. You can't make any sound at all. Your airway is completely blocked. My breaking point came three weeks ago. A patient I discharged was readmitted after a near fatal choking incident in his flat. He looked at me and said, no, Emma, I did everything you told me. It didn't work. And he was right. I had failed him. Not because I'm incompetent, but because medical guidelines assume someone else is present. Solo living wasn't part of the equation when these protocols were written. 1,399 people died from choking between 2018 and 2022 in the UK. 90% over 50. Many found a loan. Every single one surrounded by evidence they tried the techniques we taught them. The techniques that don't work when you're the only person in the room. So I started doing something off protocol, off the record. I began telling patients about airlift technology during discharge conversations. It's a completely different approach. Instead of pushing air up from empty lungs, it pulls the obstruction out from above using powerful suction. Three steps. Place the mask over your mouth. Push down to create a seal. Pull the plunger. Seconds later, airway clear. It's designed specifically for people who are alone. Not adapted from two person techniques, but built from the ground up for solo emergencies. Tested on over 300 mannequins, already saved thousands of lives. I thought I'd get reprimanded for recommending it. Instead, other nurses started asking me about it. Turns out, we're all tired of lying. But here's what you need to know. Counterfeits are everywhere. Dangerous fake devices that lack proper one-way valves. They can push obstructions deeper and kill you. When you're alone, device failure isn't disappointing. It's fatal. You need genuine devices with UKCA certification and verified serial numbers. Until the NHS updates discharge protocols for solo living adults, I'll keep breaking the rules to save lives because I refuse to keep lying to people who deserve the truth. Click the button below this video right now. Not later, not tomorrow, now. Watch my full presentation where I show you exactly how this technology works and how to verify you're getting a genuine, life-saving device. Because the next time I discharge someone, I want to tell them, you'll be fine and actually mean it. Stop accepting lies. Start demanding solutions. Click below now before you forget and this moment passes. Your life, or your loved one's life, is worth two minutes of honesty.",
