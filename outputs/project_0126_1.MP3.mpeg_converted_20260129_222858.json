      "phrase": "and found out the real root cause of neuropathic It turns out that the nerve cells in our feet are just like every other cell in our body. They need a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function properly. However, as we get older, our blood circulation starts to get worse, as our blood vessels naturally weaker. This decline is first felt in the feet as they are furthest from the heart. This gets even worse if you are diabetic because excess blood sugar causes the blood vessels to shrink further, restricting blood flow. Because of this, the oxygen supply to peripheral nerves in the feet decreases, leading to the nerve fibers being damaged. This is what causes those burning pains, those unbearable tingling sensations and those awful, numbing, neuropathic flare-ups. The nerve cells in your feet are literally suffocating and dying every day because they are not getting an adequate supply of oxygenated blood, but there's hope. The National Institute of Health published a study stating that peripheral nerves have the ability to regenerate as long as the underlying nerve cell has not be killed. If you're still feeling burning and tingling pain in your feet, it's actually really good news as it means your nerve cells are still alive and have not been killed. Taking all of this information into account, Emily and her grandson worked on a way to increase the blood flow in the feet so that the nerve cells get the oxygen they need and the pain goes away for good. The best way to increase circulation is moving around, but we know that when you are in pain, that's the last thing you want to do. Another solution many people praise is physiotherapy, as it increases blood circulation around feet. But shortly after the session ends, blood circulation levels drop, forcing you to return again and again, and pay hundreds of pounds per week to maintain the hamster wheel of relief. That's when Emily and her grandson knew exactly what they needed to do. They needed to find a way to increase blood flow around the feet, not for a short time, but for as long as you need. So together they designed a one-of-a-kind pair of compression socks that could skyrocket blood flow around her feet for as long as she needed. Emily decided to test the socks herself and she couldn't believe what happened. After just 15 minutes, a numbness was replaced with a warm comfort as the sensation she had lost returned to her feet. Then later that day, she wore them to bed, falling asleep straight away without her burning, stabbing pains flaring up. Her pain was soothed as a constant supply of oxygen. and nutrients started flowing throughout her feet, fueling the nerve regeneration process and successfully alleviating the neuropathic pain in her feet. But Emily didn't tell anyone. She wasn't a businesswoman. She wasn't trying to sell anything. And honestly, she thought maybe she just got lucky. Maybe it wouldn't work for anyone else. So she kept it to herself. Then, a few months later, her close friend Margaret shared some terrifying news. Margaret's doctor had just told her that if her circulation didn't improve soon, they would need to start discussing amputation. Emily knew she had to do something. She gave Margaret a pair of the socks, hoping they would work for her too. Two weeks later, Margaret went back for her routine checker. Her doctor ran the usual tests and couldn't believe the results. Her circulation had improved significantly. He asked her what she'd been doing differently. Amputation was no longer being discussed. Margaret wanted to tell every Emily resisted. She kept saying they weren't scientists and she wasn't trying to start a company. But Margaret, if she told her friends, they told others. Suddenly, Emily was getting calls from people she never met, begging her for help. And the socks kept working. Her grandson finally convinced her. her that people were losing their feet every day, and she had something that could help. He was right. Staying silent felt selfish. So Emily made a decision she never expected eight. She partnered with FlowFit, a UK medical startup, and with the help of neuropathy experts and product developers, they finalized the design and brought the solution to market. They go by the name FlowFit Sox, the latest innovation in compression therapy that eliminates tingling, burning, and stabbing neuropathic foot pain",
